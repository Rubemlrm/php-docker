# PHP Custom docker

This repo has php images for apache/fpm based on the oficial php images from php 5.6 to 7.2.
The only difference about this images and the official ones , is that this images as already some extensions installed that i use for mysql, postgres, mcrypt and other packages.


If you need a clean php image i recommend you the official ones.
